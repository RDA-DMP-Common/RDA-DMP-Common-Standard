It can be a formal statement describing how research data will be managed and documented throughout a research project and the terms regarding the subsequent deposit of the data with a data repository for long-term management and preservation (Library and Archives Canada). DMP's are living documents that outline a projects plans for research data management. The content, format and length of DMPs depend on the nature of the given research project. DMPs can be developed to guide a single research project or span a multiproject research initiative or longer-term program of research. The DMP submitted at the application stage could, depending on the complexity and duration of the project, be presented as a more high-level outline and then be expanded on throughout the life of the project enabling automatic exchange, integration, and validation of information provided in DMPs. Machine-actonable DMP's (maDMP) are designed to support the exchange of information between systems, to provide basic interoperability between systems producing or consuming maDMPs, acting on behalf of stakeholders involved in the research life cycle (researchers, funders, repository managers, ICT providers, librarians, etc.) and the information represented over the whole DMP lifecycle (Research Data Alliance).

dmp/indigenous_considerations/research_method,"""...Indigenous research needs to reflect Indigenous contexts and world views: that is, they must come from an Indigenous paradigm rather than an Indigenous perspective. ...One major difference between the dominant paradigms and an Indigenous paradigm is that the dominant paradigms build on the fundamental belief that knowledge is an individual entity: the researcher is an individual in search of knowledge, knowledge is something that is gained, and therefore knowledge may be owned by an individual. An Indigenous paradigm comes from the fundamental belief that knowledge is relational. Knowledge is shared with all of creation. It is not just interpersonal relationships, not just with the research subjects I may be working with, but it is a relationship with all of creation. It is with the cosmos, it is with the animals, with the plants, with the earth that we share this knowledge. It goes beyond the idea of individual knowledge to the concept of relational knowledge.""
